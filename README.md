# TE-2-44-TRICK-SWITCH

"So? What's the trick?" you ask. "The circuit looks perfectly normal to me". When you build up the circuit you will find the switching plate, called a TOUCH PLATE, has only ONE wire connecting it to the circuit. Now anybody with even the slightest idea of electrical circuits knows you need two wires for a switch to operate. Thus the trick. We need only ONE wire! Unfortunately nearly everyone also knows about touch controls. We see them in lifts and touch pads to open doors so the day may be nearly past when a one wire touch switch has any real impact. Anyway it does provide a neat project with potential for experimenting and you may find a new use for a touch plate in the process. This circuit does not have a "one touch and it's on" or "one touch and it's off" ability as the random chance of the LED finishing up lit is 500.

## HOW IT WORKS:
The TRICK SWITCH uses 4 transistors to create two individual building blocks. The first two transistors form a DARLINGTON PAIR (super-alpha pair) in which the gain of the circuit is very close to the product of the two transistors. When you touch the TOUCH PLATE with your finger, your body is acting like an antenna, picking up stray hum similar to the noise you get when you touch the input of am amplifier. This 50Hz hum is amplified sufficiently by the two transistors to trigger the second section. Transistors Q3 and Q4 make up the second building block and form a BISTABLE SWITCH or BISTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR. This means it has two states and requires triggering into each state. This circuit does not possess any frequency of its own but will flip from one state to the other at a rate determined by ,the pulses arriving at Ci,C2. A red LED provides the load for transistor Q4 and when the TOUCH PLATE is touched with your finger it will start the LED flashing at about 25Hz or so according to the frequency of the stray hum. When your finger is removed the LED will immediately settle into one of its two conditions. Either fully 'ON' or fully 'OFF'. Since the components surrounding Q3 and Q4 are of equal value, the chance of the LED remaining lit is 500. To provide guaranteed triggering for the bistable section, two steering diodes are included. Their operation is as follows: Suppose the circuit is in one of its two stable states with Q3 cut-off and Q4 conducting. This means that diode D1 will have a positive voltage on its cathode via R4 and R5 and the anode will be brought to ground via the 22k resistor R7. This diode will be reverse biased. Diode D2 will have its cathode near ground potential via the 47k resistor R9 and its anode near positive potential via R6 and R5. This diode will be forward biased. The placement of the two steering diodes makes them only capable of turning off their respective transistor. This means that the next pulse appearing through capacitor C2 can have no effect on transistor Q3 since it is already cut-off but a negative-going pulse through C3,will remove the forward bias on (14, via diode D2, and turn off the transistor. The voltage on its collector will rise and turn on Q3. Thus the circuit will change state sharply and remain in this state until a suitable negative-going pulse causes it to "flop". 



## CONSTRUCTION:
The circuit contains no critical-value components and almost any NPN transistors will be suitable. The resistors need not be the exact values shown in the diagram. You can use any value resistor either side of the one specified provided you keep the symmetry between the two bistable multivibrator transistors so that the "mark-space" ratio will be equal and the chance of the LED being left illuminated kept at 50%. Build the circuit on a small piece of veroboard. A handy size to buy is 15 holes x 81 holes which can be cut to length for a number of different projects. If you lay out the parts carefully, you will not have to cut any of the copper tracks; a very awkward and messy operation if you don't have the spot-face cutter. 
## Footnote:
Actually the TRANSISTOR PAGE is designed to highlight the inefficiency and complexity of building circuits with transistors. This TRICK SWITCH is a perfect example. The same effect can be performed with one simple 50c IC and just 7 external components! Consider the speed in assembling 8 parts compared to the TRICK SWITCH circuit with its array of transistors, resistors, diodes and capacitors. Hopefully you will be gradually weaned off transistor projects and onto "little black packages". For the moment we will use the TRANSISTOR PAGE projects as an insight into the operation of various modules or building blocks. Consider them purely as this. Any circuits you wish to build should utilize spare or used components to keep construction cost to a minimum and justify their assembly.
